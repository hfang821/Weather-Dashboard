# Weather-Dashboard

## Link to the Deployed Application:
https://hfang821.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/ 

## Description:

* This website is designed to help people to check the weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV Index) of different cities in the world.
* This project was completed based on the JavaScript Web API concepts, as well as utilizing third-party apis to efficiently perform the operations (Moment.js, Bootstrap, JQuery).
* This project also links to the server-side apis from https://openweathermap.org/api to extract up-to-date weather information and 16-day weather forecasts.
* I have learned the ways to fetch server-side apis in order to extract external databases. 


## Built By:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScipt
* JavaScript APIs

## How to Install:

Windows Users: 
* Open Gitbash, navigate towards your project location from your root by using "cd ./ project location"
* Choose a clone option from my "Weather-Dashboard" repository (either HTTPS or SSH should work)
* In Gitbash, type "git clone HTTPS or SSH"
* Once the clone is successful, you are ready to go!

MacOS Users:

Note: This website does not contain all the cities around the globe as the database is limited to the longitutde and lattitude information stored in the citylist.js file.

## Future Improvement:
This site can be optimized by including a larger list of city locations OR use a different API that takes the citynames/zip codes in the query parameters.
